Variable Scoping
Understanding variable scope is crucial for efficient programming. C++ provides three primary scopes:

Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function and accessible anywhere within the code file.
Local Scope: Variables declared within a function, accessible only within that function.
Block Scope: Variables declared within a specific block (e.g., within {}), usable solely within that block.
By managing scopes effectively, we maintain code clarity, reduce errors, and enhance maintainability.

sizeof() Function
The sizeof() function is a compile-time operator in C++ that computes the size of a data type or object in bytes. For instance, using sizeof(int) might return 4 on a 32-bit system. Understanding memory requirements is essential for optimizing high-performance applications.

Functions in Depth
An extensive analysis of functions highlighted the differences between declaration and definition. Functions are declared using a prototype, indicating the return type and parameters, while the definition outlines the executable code block. Below is a simple function example:

// Declaration
int add(int a, int b);

// Definition
int add(int a, int b){
    return a + b;
}
Functions promote code reusability and manage complexity by abstracting logic. Five comprehensive examples illustrated variations like parameterized functions, returning multiple values, and using default arguments.
