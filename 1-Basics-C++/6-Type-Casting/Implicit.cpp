// This session delves into Type Casting in C++, which is the conversion of one data type to another. The two primary forms of typecasting in C++ are Implicit Typecasting and Explicit Typecasting. Below is a structured insight into these concepts:

// Implicit Typecasting
// Implicit Typecasting, also known as automatic type conversion, is performed by the compiler without any explicit instruction from the programmer. This is typically done when converting a smaller data type to a larger data type, ensuring no data loss
// int num = 10;
// double result = num; // Implicit conversion from int to double
// Implicit typecasting, also known as coercion, is automatically performed by the compiler in C++ to convert data from one type to another without explicit instruction from the programmer.
