/* 📘 C++ Iterators and Iterating Algorithms
🔁 std::for_each
Purpose: Applies a given function to each element in a range.

Use case: Processing or modifying elements.

🔍 std::find
Purpose: Searches for a specific element in a range.

Returns: Iterator to the first matching element or end() if not found.

🔍 std::find_if
Purpose: Finds the first element that satisfies a given condition (predicate).

🔢 std::count
Purpose: Counts how many times a specific value appears in a range.

🔢 std::count_if
Purpose: Counts how many elements satisfy a condition (predicate).

📈 std::sort
Purpose: Sorts elements in ascending order by default.

Note: Can also use custom comparator for custom sorting.

🔄 std::reverse
Purpose: Reverses the order of elements in a given range.

🔁 std::rotate
Purpose: Rotates elements such that a specific element becomes the first one.

❌ std::unique
Purpose: Removes consecutive duplicate elements from a sorted range.

Note: Needs to be followed by erase() to actually remove from container.

🔀 std::partition
Purpose: Divides the range into two groups based on a condition (predicate).

Result: Elements satisfying the predicate come before the rest.
